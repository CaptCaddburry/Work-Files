This macro is used within a Word document as a payroll deduction form with HR.
Once the macro is added to the document, I created a "button/link" to trigger the macro.

***Make sure that only 1 laptop device is selected and select the last checkbox is the user wants the laptop shipped to them.
The macro will replace the placeholders with the following paydates and the calculated price options.***
