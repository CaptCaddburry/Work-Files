# Work-Files

So I created this program to use at my work so I could Auto-Login to all the websites that I had to use.

I did not upload every single file, because it is the same file but changed depending on what website you are logging into.

You would run the "Apps.bat" file and then based on your selection, it would then run the corresponding .vbs file.
